# Tailwind

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern websites without ever leaving your HTML. Instead of writing custom CSS, you apply pre-defined utility classes directly to your HTML elements to style them.

Utility-first: No need to write custom CSS for most use cases.
Highly customizable: Configure colors, spacing, fonts, breakpoints, etc., in tailwind.config.js.
Responsive & mobile-first: Easily handle different screen sizes with responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.).
Built for productivity: Encourages component-based design and fast prototyping.

In Tailwind CSS, you use predefined utility classes directly inside your HTML to style your elements — no need to write custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.

# Reason: To Prevent Blocking the Page Rendering
When the browser encounters a <script> tag, it stops and loads, parses, and executes the JavaScript before continuing to render the rest of the page.
If your script is at the top (inside <head> or before the content), the browser delays showing any HTML below it — causing a slower user experience.

# CLI stands for Command Line Interface — it’s a way to interact with your computer or tools (like Node.js, Git, Tailwind, etc.) by typing commands instead of clicking with a mouse.
