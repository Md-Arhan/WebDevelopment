If you want to push an existing local folder/project to GitHub:
‚ùå DO NOT initialize the repo on GitHub with:
a README.md

a .gitignore

a license

Because that adds a commit to the remote repo, which creates that "unrelated histories" issue you're seeing.

OR, if you've already added README on GitHub
Just like you're doing now:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
# then resolve and push
